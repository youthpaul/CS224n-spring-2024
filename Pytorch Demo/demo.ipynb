In one pass (meaning a call to forward()), our model will try to generate the correct label for one word. Let's say our model is trying to generate the correct label 1 for Paris.

In our earlier example for Paris, if we have a window size of 1, that means our model will look at the words that come immediately before and after Paris, which are to, and, well, nothing. Now, this raises another issue. Paris is at the end of our sentence, so there isn't another word following it. Remember that we define the input dimensions of our PyTorch models when we are initializing them. If we set the window size to be 1, it means that our model will be accepting 3 words in every pass. We cannot have our model expect 2 words from time to time.\n",

    "We have learned about batches in class. Waiting our whole training corpus to be processed before making an update is constly. On the other hand, updating the parameters after every training example causes the loss to be less stable between updates. To combat these issues, we instead update our parameters after training on **a batch of data**. This allows us to get a better estimate of the gradient of the global loss. In this section, we will learn how to structure our data into batches using the `torch.util.data.DataLoader` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be calling the DataLoader class as follows: `DataLoader(data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)`. The batch_size parameter determines the number of examples per batch. In every epoch, we will be iterating over all the batches using the DataLoader. The order of batches is deterministic by default, but we can ask DataLoader to shuffle the batches by setting the shuffle parameter to True. This way we ensure that we don't encounter a bad batch multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If provided, DataLoader **passes*8 the batches it prepares to the `collate_fn`. We can write a custom function to pass to the collate_fn parameter in order to print stats about our batch or perform extra processing. In our case, we will use the collate_fn to:\n",

This creates an issue because when calculating the loss, we need to know the actual number of words in a given example. We will also keep track of this number in the function we pass to the collate_fn parameter.\n",
    "Because our version of the collate_fn function will need to access to our word_to_ix dictionary (so that it can turn words into indices), we will make use of the partial function in Python, which passes the parameters we give to the function we pass it."
